    getExternalCycle(model::CAGD.Model, dim::Int, cells::Array{Int,1})::Int

Evaluates wich `dim`-coboundary between `cells` is the external one.

The function expects `cells` as the indices of ALL the `dim`-coboundary
within the same component and evaluate wich of those is the external one.

It returns the index of the external cell within the `cells`.

Evaluates the strict containment relation between `dim`-cells.
