	Alias declation of LAR-specific data structure.
	Dense `Array{Number,2,1}` ``M x N`` to store the position of *vertices* (0-cells)
	of a *cellular complex*. The number of rows ``M`` is the dimension
	of the embedding space. The number of columns ``N`` is the number of vertices.

		Cells = Array{Array{Int,1},1}

	Alias declation of LAR-specific data structure.
	Dense `Array` to store the indices of vertices of `P-cells`
	of a cellular complex.
	The linear space of `P-chains` is generated by `Cells` as a basis.
	Simplicial `P-chains` have ``P+1`` vertex indices for `cell` element in `Cells` array.
	Cuboidal `P-chains` have ``2^P`` vertex indices for `cell` element in `Cells` array.
	Other types of chain spaces may have different numbers of vertex indices for `cell`
	element in `Cells` array.

		Chain = SparseArrays.SparseVector{Int8,Int}

	Alias declation of LAR-specific data structure.
	Binary `SparseVector` to store the coordinates of a `chain` of `N-cells`. It is
	`nnz=1` with `value=1` for the coordinates of an *elementary N-chain*, constituted by
	a single *N-chain*.

	"""
		ChainOp = SparseArrays.SparseMatrixCSC{Int8,Int}

	Alias declation of LAR-specific data structure.
	`SparseMatrix` in *Compressed Sparse Column* format, contains the coordinate
	representation of an operator between linear spaces of `P-chains`.
	Operators ``P-Boundary : P-Chain -> (P-1)-Chain``
	and ``P-Coboundary : P-Chain -> (P+1)-Chain`` are typically stored as
	`ChainOp` with elements in ``{-1,0,1}`` or in ``{0,1}``, for
	*signed* and *unsigned* operators, respectively.
	"""

	"""
		ChainComplex = Array{ChainOp,1}

	Alias declation of LAR-specific data structure. It is a
	1-dimensional `Array` of `ChainOp` that provides storage for either the
	*chain of boundaries* (from `D` to `0`) or the transposed *chain of coboundaries*
	(from `0` to `D`), with `D` the dimension of the embedding space, which may be either
	``R^2`` or ``R^3``.
	"""

	"""
		LARmodel = Tuple{Points,Array{Cells,1}}

	Alias declation of LAR-specific data structure.
	`LARmodel` is a pair (*Geometry*, *Topology*), where *Geometry* is stored as
	`Points`, and *Topology* is stored as `Array` of `Cells`. The number of `Cells`
	values may vary from `1` to `N+1`.
